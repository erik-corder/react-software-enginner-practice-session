# React.js software engineer practical test

In this practical test, we build a simple CRUD application called üçî **The Fridge**. We use this application to see what we have in our fridge at a glance and when do they expire.

_Please read the instructions properly before you proceed._

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack to be used

- React.js (Latest)
- SASS Stylesheets (scss) / TailwindCSS / CSS
- Axios http client

# ‚öîÔ∏è Objectives

Each objective will be evaluated individually. Please use the given API endpoints below.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Objective One

Develop the UI following the given üé® [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/IPXZBpnc20QUbGcuiv1K9Z/TheFridge-React-Practical-Test?node-id=0%3A1), using react `functional components` and `scss/css stylesheets` for styles. (Please **DO NOT** use any third party component libraries or css libraries. write custom code. You can use TailwindCSS for utility classes)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Objective Two

1. List the items with details as pointed in the Figma design, once data completely fetched from API.
2. Show a pre-loading message/spinner while fetching the List items from API.
3. Show Total items count by counting the list items.
4. Show `Expiring soon` label if _Expiry date_ is due in one month.
5. Show `Expired` label if _Expiry date_ is passed.
6. Show `Healthy` label if _Expiry date_ is **NOT** due in less than one month.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Objective Three

1. Add form functionality to add a New item to the fridge.
2. Each added item should show on the items list without a page refresh.
3. Add a date picker to the `Expiry date` input field. (You can use ANY datepicker)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Objective Four (Optional)

1. Add List item delete functionality.
